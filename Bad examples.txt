Quite possibly the worst movie I have ever seen. I mean this. Even bad movies are better, because at least the directors of those know thy're not making art. What sent this picture plummeting off the scale, earning a complete zero, was the impression I had that Jackson thought he was creating a work of art. What a joke. In fact, I wish it were a joke -- a bunch of one-dimensional characters speaking a sort of bad-Shakespeare dialect. Good lord
Unrealistic, false, boring and a thousand more aspects for not to see it, stupid, watching that movie is an idiocy.
An embarrassing, cringeworthy self insert vigilante fanfic for gravy seals who fantasize about being the 'good guy with a gun'. 50 shades of grey for the ammosexual crowd
Horrible acting, poorly written, poor production quality, can't believe I wasted almost 2 hours on this.
This movie is a nightmare, I tend to not watch movies much so I can't say a lot about high quality, but this movie completely mocks school shooters and makes a joke out of it, as you see everyone stumbling around and really making a serious topic into Die hard. I won't lie, it made me angry, I did come into this movie with low expectations because Ben Shapiro, but this felt more than just the weird conservative Christian ideas shoved in, this tended to be just completely unbelievable, and I feel as if a lot of the characteristics were almost intentionally done, not to mention the record of the studio behind this and just I can't structure much more together because I can't really find a way to summarize how much i hate this
